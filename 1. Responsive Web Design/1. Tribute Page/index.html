            <h2>A Tribute to the Late Film Director</h2>
            <p id="description">
                Stanley Kubrick was an American filmmaker best known for directing Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey,

                Famed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was born in New York City on July 26, 1928, and grew up in the Bronx, New York. Kubrick never
                adjusted to or did well in school, He applied to several colleges, but he was turned down for admission by all of them.
                He also displayed early promise as a photographer for the school paper, and at age 16, began selling his photos to Look
                magazine. A year later, he was hired for the staff of the magazine.
            <br /><br />
                Kubrick began to explore the art of filmmaking in the 1950s. His first films were documentary shorts financed by friends
                and relatives. Stanley made 10 feature films from 1957 to 1998, with early releases including the acclaimed films Spartacus
                (1960). He then released his most popular film, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The film earned Kubrick 13 Academy Award nominations.
                <h3>Later Releases</h3>
                He then went on to win further acclaim with the films Clockwork Orange (1971) and Barry Lyndon (1975), for which he personally
                approved each costume for thousands of extras in battle scenes. The Shining in (1980), which evidenced his predilection
                for multiple takes (he shot one scene with star Jack Nicholson 134 times), and the popular drama Full Metal Jacket (1987).
